The following is my attempt at an assignmet written in html text/javascript code.

# Task 1: Favourite TV Shows (Countries)
Ask the user to enter Five of their favourite countries they like to visit. 
Once they have entered the countries, display the results. Use an array to store their favourite countries.

# Task 2: Favourite Country
Ask the user to enter their favourite countries and the capital of that country. 
Save the countries in one array and the Capital of that Country in another array. 
Ask for five favourite Countries. Then ask the user for one of their most favourite country. 
Find the Capital of that Country and display it to the screen.
